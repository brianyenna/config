# Instructions for using the `vimrc` config file
For the latest `vimrc` config file, I mainly followed the instructions provided
in https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide

Note, when adding a new plugin to the `vimrc` config file, you must also
install the plugin. This can be done by running: 
```
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```
